Question 8 & 9: I have some doubts regarding this questions. 

Question 10: Difference Between Left JOIN and Full Outer JOIN.
While considering Two tables say Left Table and Right Table
Left join will help you to return all the rows from the left table and also returns the matched rows from the right table. If in a left table, there are no matched rows then columns of the table on the right will return Null Values.
Whereas in the Full outer join it will return all the rows from both the tables. And if there are no unmatched rows in the left table then the columns of the right table will return Null values. Similarly when there are no matched rows in the right table then from the left table it will return Null values for the unmatched columns.
